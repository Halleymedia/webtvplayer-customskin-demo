# Custom skin for Civicam WebTvPlayer
An absolute bare example of how implementing a custom skin.
No frameworks involved, this is just the simplest possible demo. **No Babel included**, so it won't work on IE.

## Getting started
Just start the webserver by running `npm run serve`, then open the address `http://localhost:3000`.

Note: It has to be run from `http://localhost:3000` or you'll stumble into CORS issues. You're free to host the example wherever you like but then you'll have to [launch your browser without CORS](https://alfilatov.com/posts/run-chrome-without-cors/).
